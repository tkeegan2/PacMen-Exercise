# PacMen-Exercise

## Description

For this project, I animated images of PacMan using a JavaScript application. The JavaScriot allows a user to, on click, have the PacMan move back and forth across the comptuer screen.

## Features

- PacMan moves back and forth across the screen.
- Clicking on the screen starts PacMan's movement.
- PacMan changes direction after it hits a certain point on each side.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click on the screen to see PacMan in action.
4. Enjoy playing with PacMan!

## Future Improvements

I had some trouble with this assignment when I was trying to get PacMan to walk all the way to the right of the screen.  Ultimately, I was not able to get him to walk all the way there.  I would like to improve that going forward because it would provide uniform experiences across all screen sizes.  Whereas now, PacMan walks to a preset spot but that spot could be just a small amount of one screen while being a much larger proportion of a different screen.
